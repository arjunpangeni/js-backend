The **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** is a design pattern used to separate concerns in application development, helping organize code into logical parts. It divides the application into three interconnected components:

1. **Model**: Manages the data and business logic. It interacts with the database and performs operations like creating, reading, updating, or deleting data (CRUD).
2. **View**: Represents the user interface (UI). It displays the data from the model and sends user input to the controller.
3. **Controller**: Acts as a mediator between the Model and the View. It handles the user input, interacts with the Model, and updates the View accordingly.

### MVC with Express.js, React and Mongodb.

In this context, Express.js will be used on the backend (server-side), while React will be used on the frontend (client-side). Here's how MVC applies in this stack:

#### 1. **Model** (Express + Database)
- The **Model** is where the data and database operations are defined.
- In Express.js, we can use a database like MongoDB or PostgreSQL to store data.
- we would create models using a library like Mongoose (for MongoDB) or Sequelize (for SQL databases).

Example:
```javascript
// models/Product.js (with Mongoose for MongoDB)
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const productSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  price: Number,
  description: String
});

const Product = mongoose.model('Product', productSchema);
module.exports = Product;
```

#### 2. **View** (React Frontend)
- The **View** in this context is our React frontend. React components display the data fetched from the backend and allow us to interact with it (e.g., forms, buttons).
- React communicates with the controller (Express API) via HTTP requests (using `fetch` or `axios`).

Example React component to display a product:
```jsx
// components/ProductView.js
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const ProductView = () => {
  const [products, setProducts] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('/api/products')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => setProducts(data));
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Products</h1>
      <ul>
        {products.map(product => (
          <li key={product._id}>{product.name} - ${product.price}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ProductView;
```

#### 3. **Controller** (Express API)
- The **Controller** is part of our Express.js server, which processes requests from the client (React), interacts with the Model (e.g., database), and sends back responses.
- It acts as the intermediary between the frontend (View) and the database (Model).

Example Express.js controller:
```javascript
// controllers/productController.js
const Product = require('../models/Product');

// Get all products
exports.getAllProducts = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const products = await Product.find();
    res.json(products);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).send('Server Error');
  }
};
```

#### 4. **Routing** (Express Routes)
- In Express, routes connect HTTP requests to the appropriate controller methods.

Example route definition:
```javascript
// routes/productRoutes.js
const express = require('express');
const { getAllProducts } = require('../controllers/productController');

const router = express.Router();

router.get('/products', getAllProducts);

module.exports = router;
```

#### Application Flow:
1. **User interaction**: A user interacts with the frontend (React) by requesting some data or submitting a form.
2. **HTTP Request**: React makes an HTTP request (e.g., a GET request to fetch data) to the Express backend.
3. **Controller handles the request**: The Express **Controller** receives the request, interacts with the **Model** (database) to get the required data, and sends a response back to the frontend.
4. **Frontend updates the view**: React receives the data from the response and updates the **View**.

### Example Folder Structure:

```
- backend/
  - controllers/
    - productController.js
  - models/
    - Product.js
  - routes/
    - productRoutes.js
  - server.js
- frontend/
  - src/
    - components/
      - ProductView.js
```

In this setup, Express.js handles the backend, adhering to the MVC pattern, while React handles the frontend, acting as the "View" in this architecture.

there are several models used for different propose. which may be different as requirement of project.
